# GPT-Mini: A Lightweight Transformer Language Model

Welcome to GPT-Mini! This repository contains a small-scale implementation of a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language model from scratch using PyTorch. This project serves as a learning tool for understanding the inner workings of transformer-based models and for experimenting with language generation tasks on a smaller scale.

## Introduction

GPT-Mini is a simplified version of the GPT architecture, designed to be easy to understand and modify. It includes essential components such as embedding layers, multi-head attention, residual connections, and feed-forward networks, but is scaled down for educational purposes and small-scale experiments.

## Features

- **Small-scale GPT Implementation:** Easy to understand and modify.
- **PyTorch-based:** Leverages the power of PyTorch for tensor operations and neural network layers.
- **Token Embeddings and Positional Encodings:** Includes both input token embeddings and positional encodings.
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention:** Implements multi-head causal self-attention for autoregressive text generation.
- **Residual Connections and Layer Normalization:** Ensures stable training and better convergence.
- **Feed-Forward Networks:** Provides depth to the model for more complex representations.
- **Text Generation:** Supports autoregressive text generation with a simple API.

## Installation

To get started with GPT-Mini, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GPT-Mini.git
cd GPT-Mini
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training

To train GPT-Mini on your own dataset, you need to prepare your data and modify the training script accordingly. Here is an example of how to initialize and train the model:

```python
import torch
from model import BigramLM

# Initialize model parameters
context_length = 32
n_decoder_blocks = 6
dropout = 0.1
vocab_size = 1000
d_model = 512

# Create model instance
model = BigramLM(context_length, n_decoder_blocks, dropout, vocab_size, d_model).cuda()

# Define your training loop here
# ...
```

### Text Generation

You can use the pre-trained or newly trained model to generate text. Here's an example of how to generate text:

```python
import torch

# Load your trained model
# ...

# Generate text
generated_text = model.generate(torch.zeros((1, 1), dtype=torch.long).cuda(), 2000)
print(generated_text)
```

## Example

Here's a complete example that initializes the model, generates text, and decodes it using a tokenizer:

```python
import torch
from model import BigramLM

# Initialize model parameters
context_length = 32
n_decoder_blocks = 6
dropout = 0.1
vocab_size = 1000
d_model = 512

# Create model instance
model = BigramLM(context_length, n_decoder_blocks, dropout, vocab_size, d_model).cuda()

# Generate text
generated_text = model.generate(torch.zeros((1, 1), dtype=torch.long).cuda(), 2000)
print(generated_text)

# Assuming `tokenizer` is defined and has a `decode` method
# print(tokenizer.decode(list(map(int, generated_text[0].cpu().numpy()))))
```
